The Contraption Company is a product studio crafting tools that help people work online.

We build tools like:

* [Postcard](https://postcard.page) - Stay in touch with or without social media - using a personal website + newsletter hosted on your own domain. 
* [Booklet](https://www.booklet.community) - Calm communities, for people who can't stay on chat all day.
